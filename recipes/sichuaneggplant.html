        <h1>Sichuan Eggplant</h1>
        <p><img src="images/sichuaneggplant.jpg" alt="Sichuan Eggplant"></p>
        <h2>Food Description</h2>
        <p>Don't let the name fool you—there's no fish here. Instead, this Sichuanese eggplant 
            classic is deeply flavored with garlic, ginger, and pickled chiles, aromatics that 
            are often associated with fish cookery.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound 5 ounces (600g) eggplants (1–2 large)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cooking oil, for deep-frying</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Sichuan chile bean paste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger</li>
            <li>10 tablespoons (150ml) hot stock or water</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons superfine sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Chinese light soy sauce</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon potato starch, mixed with 1 tablespoon cold water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Chinkiang vinegar</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons thinly sliced scallion greens</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the eggplants into batons about 3/4 inch (2cm) thick and 2 3/4 inches (7cm) long. Sprinkle with salt, mix well and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rinse the eggplant, drain well and pat dry with paper towels. Heat the deep-frying oil to around 390°F (200°C) (hot enough to sizzle vigorously around a test piece of eggplant). Add the eggplant, in two or three batches, and deep-fry for about 3 minutes, until tender and a little golden. Drain well on paper towels and set aside.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour off all but 3 tablespoons oil from the wok and return to medium heat. Add the chile bean paste and stir-fry until the oil is red and fragrant: take care not to burn the paste (move the wok away from the burner if you think it might be overheating). Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry until they smell delicious.</li>
            <li>Tip in the stock or water, sugar and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then add the eggplant, nudging the batons gently into the sauce so they do not break apart. Simmer for a minute or so to allow the eggplant to absorb the flavors.</li>
            <li>Give the potato starch mixture a stir and add it gradually, in about three stages, adding just enough to thicken the sauce to a luxurious gravy (you probably won’t need it all). Tip in the vinegar and all but 1 tablespoon of the scallion greens, then stir for a few seconds to fuse the flavors.</li>
            <li>Turn out onto a serving dish, scatter over the remaining scallion greens and serve.</li>
        </ol>
