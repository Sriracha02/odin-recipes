        <h2>Food Description</h2>
        <p>Mapo tofu '麻婆豆腐' is an iconic Chinese spicy tofu dish originated from the Sichuan province.</p>
        <p>The direct translation of 'mapo' means 'pock-marked grandma'. This dish is said to be named after 
            an elderly lady (restaurant owner), the inventor of this dish who had pock-marks on her face.</p>
        <p>This recipe is one that I grew up eating (in a Taiwanese household) and is a version that is milder 
            than the authentic Sichuan version. The ones Sichuan restaurants would be spicier with a richer red colour.</p>
        <p>So if you love spicy foods but can't take too much of them, this not too spicy mapo tofu recipe is perfect for you! 
            Also, you can easily adjust the spiciness of this dish by adding more or less chilli powder or chilli flakes to suit your tastebuds.</p>
